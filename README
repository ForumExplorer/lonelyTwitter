This app is known as Habit Tracker. It is supposed to take in a habit
record it, and then track how many times you successfully complete said habit.
You can set what days the habit is due, though that is just a visual reminder,
as you can complete a habit on any day. You can also clear all completions
if you want a fresh start on the habit.
